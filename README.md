# Graphics Project
## About :thought_balloon:
This project consists of a photorealistic presentation of 3D models using the OpenGL library. The user will be able to directly manipulate the scene of objects using the mouse and keyboard inputs.

## Features :white_check_mark:
The following features can be found inside my project:
- Directional light, spot light and point lights.
- Shadow algorithm with sampling for enhanced realism of the scene.
- Collision detection for a tumbleweed that can be controlled from the keyboard.
- Fog, wind and object generation.
- Night mode where the user can see the scene using a flashlight.
- Skybox: gives a good sense of realism.
- Scene visualization: using keyboard and mouse.
- Scene preview: using an algorithm based on BÃ©zier curves.
